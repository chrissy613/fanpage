    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p> Pity Sex was an American alternative rock band from Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
        Having formed and recorded a demo in 2011, eventually releasing it as a split cassette with Brave Bird, Pity Sex would go on to release their debut EP, Dark World a year later on Forward Records to positive reviews.
        In 2013 the band released their debut album, Feast of Love, on Run For Cover Records. Following the band signing to Run For Cover Records the Dark World EP would also be re-released through Run For Cover Records. 2014 saw them touring with labelmates Adventures, Basement, and Tigers Jaw, among others. In September of that year, the band also toured Australia for the first time. In October 2014, the band released a split EP with Adventures, with each band's side featuring one original song and one cover. Pity Sex chose to cover the Pixies' "Gigantic". Guitarist Brennan Greaves helped to create the artwork, in collaboration with Kimi Hanauer of Adventures. In the summer of 2015, the band completed a US tour with punk rock band Ceremony. It was around this time that recording for their next album would be completed.

    <p>On September 28th, 2015, the band released a new digital single, entitled "What Might Soothe You?", through NPR. The single was released alongside a statement announcing the impending release of their new album "White Hot Moon." The album was released in the spring of 2016, and was be preceded by a vinyl edition of "What Might Soothe You?". In August 2016, it was announced that vocalist/guitarist Britty Drake was to leave the band after a final show supporting Best Coast. The band completed their remaining tour dates in Japan and Australia with Greaves taking on full lead vocal duties and Anthony Huebel filling in on lead guitar. Following the conclusion of their tour, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in October 2016. The band released their final single and video, "Burden You," created by Playlab, in conjunction with the announcement as a parting gift of sorts.
